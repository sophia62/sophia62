- **[🎙️ Voice-Controlled Multi-Device Assistant](https://github.com/sophia62/Hackathon2025/blob/main/README.md)**  
  Voice-driven assistant built to **avoid AI hallucinations** when executing multiple commands simultaneously. Uses offline speech recognition, local LLMs, and streaming TTS.
  
- **[AI Banking Project – Bank Marketing Prediction](https://github.com/sophia62/AI-Banking-Project)**  
  End-to-end machine learning project predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit using a dataset of 37,000+ records. Implemented data preprocessing, one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and a Decision Tree classifier, with evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a mini holdout validation to assess real-world generalization.

### 📱 Application Development
- **[Sun Buddy – Sunlight Wellness App](https://github.com/sophia62/SunBuddyApp/tree/main)**  
  iOS sunlight-tracking app built with SwiftUI and later redesigned using Base44. Presented at the IDS Conference; focuses on habit formation, accessibility, and environmental wellness.

- **[Food Symptom Tracker](https://github.com/sophia62/food-symptoms-tracker)**  
  App for tracking dietary intake and symptoms to identify patterns and triggers.

## 🎓 Advanced Academic Projects (Code Not Public)

These projects were completed as part of advanced software engineering coursework.  
Code is not publicly available due to course policy, but the projects emphasize **architecture, design strategy, quality metrics, and system-level thinking**.

- **Orbital Simulator (C++ · Software Architecture & Simulation Design)**  
  Designed a physics-based orbital simulation focusing on **class relationship design**, **polymorphism**, and **system adaptability**. Applied concepts including, *object creation strategies*, *large inheritance tree management*, and *redundancy reduction*. Evaluated design quality using metrics such as **adaptability, alignment, and testability**, and practiced debugging and integration testing for dynamic, stateful systems.

- **Skeet Game Refactor (C++ · Design Patterns & Separation of Concerns)**  
  Refactored a legacy game codebase to improve **maintainability, extensibility, and clarity** using advanced **Strategy-based design patterns**. Applied concepts such as *algorithm abstraction*, *message passing*, *command passing*, *interfaces*, *layered system design*, *state management*, and *decorator-based extensions*. Emphasized **separation of concerns**, reducing coupling while enabling new behaviors without modifying existing code.
> Design documentation, UML diagrams, and architectural explanations available upon request.
